Hello, welcome to the changelog of the version 0.1.0, i've been mainly focusing on perfecting the events system, but my next objectif is to make the http requests work and easy to use. I present to you the list of changes! : (By the way I added the intents calculation lol)

#### Additions

* [**Important addition!**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] Now intents are calculated automaticly on bot launch, the feature is clearly not perfect but it work! For more informations, go in the devlog section.
* `once` function have been added, it execute the targeted function one time.
* Added a new directory called `data` which purpose is to manage data used by the library, when dispy is imported, the data module will import json file for the code to understand. It is better than importing badly files inside the \_\_init\_\_.
* Added prototype `Embed` class to make easily embed.
* Added commentary in functions for IDE's to understand.
* Added a TokenReader where you put your file for more secure storage.

#### Changes

* `eventlink` function has changed name, now you can call it using `on`.
* The handler list (dict) have been changed to a tuple containing the eventname and function to call.
* The module `intents` have been updated to function correctly with the new data system.
* Added the support for custom arguments in the `send_message` function inside `rest_api.py`.
* The license have been changed, now this version is under it.
* The function for the execution of the user functions have been updated so now, we can use while loop and input inside.

#### Substractions

* `error_codes.json` have been removed, im working on a better solution and this file doesn't help me.



## Devlog

I've been working on this version for a while, and i'm very happy to see this come together, this will not be the best version of dispy but i already achieved intents calculation which not many discord bot library's support.

How does it work? In the dispy library, there is a intents.json that contain all the event that discord can send us, the number attributed to these list are the intents id, with this, we can calculated with a pretty simple formula the intents code.

$$
X=\sum_{i=1}^{n} (1 << a_i)

Thanks for reading this... long... changelog. Have a nice day!

[^1]: IMPORTANT!!
