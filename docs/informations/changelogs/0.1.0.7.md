Release date : **january** (happy new year 2025 ðŸŽ‰)

Hello! This version is meant to make dispy very more intuitive and simple to use. These adjustments and fixes we're made when developing my own bots with dispy.

### Changelog

> **New**
>
> * Support adding reactions and removing them.
> * Snowflakes (IDs) now are represent as STR and INT, so you can compared them (e.g. is equal) with STR and INT values.
> * ISO timestamp are now automaticly converted to epoch timestamp, now dispy will only use this kind of timestamp because it is easier to manipulate it.
> * New default embed color added, called "embed-discord", it is the same color as the entire embed frame (Except for phones, constancy in discord design doesn't exist).
> * Added a caching system used by slash commands, it can store informations so it isn't define every executions.
> * _<mark style="background-color:orange;">Started working on slash commands.</mark>_

> **Fix**
>
> * Editing a message now return a message object.
> * Fixed an issue with DictWrapper, which made if the debug mode was disable, it will failed if there is an extra field.
> * Made tokens and headers attributes private so eval cannot get them (Never use it anyway).

> **Removed**
>
> * Pydantic dependency.

### How to update my code?

Now that dispy has completely removed iso timestamp, you will need to recalculate and recode parcel of your code that use the old timestamp. The epoch timestamps is using seconds and milliseconds are in decimals.

```python
# OLD
epoch_timestamp = datetime.datetime.fromisoformat(msg.timestamp).timestamp()

# NEW
epoch_timestamp = msg.timestamp
```
