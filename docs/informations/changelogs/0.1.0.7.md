### How to update my code? <picture><source srcset="../../.gitbook/assets/warning_dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/warning_light.png" alt=""></picture>

Now that dispy has completely removed iso timestamp, you will need to recalculate and recode parcel of your code that use the old timestamp. The epoch timestamps is using seconds and milliseconds are in decimals.
