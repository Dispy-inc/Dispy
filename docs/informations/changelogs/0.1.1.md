# 0.1.1

Release date : **23 April 2025**

***

Hey, this version is mainly bug fixes. Developing Dispy is becoming really difficult and too complex for me, I will still try to update it but i'm not sure I will.

### Changelog

#### New

* Now, every errors are covered by the custom dispy error display.
* Added [Appdirs](https://github.com/ActiveState/appdirs) inside Dispy for the upcoming slash commands.
* You can now add more than 1 image on your embed.

#### Changes

* Made some comment more comprehensible.
* When getting the result of an API request, you are no longer required to use `.get()`, you can directly get the value. (It was removed so don't use it)
* `bot.create_message()` was changed to `bot.send_message()`.
* **A lot of Dispy networking was optimized.**

#### Fix

* Fixed an issue with guild tag (clans) making an error for users having one.

### How to update my code?

Is there anyone using the lib anyway ðŸ˜‚?

1. Replace every `bot.create_message()` to `bot.send_message()`.&#x20;
2. When getting the result of an API request, you need to remove your `.get()` and directly get the values.
3. Change the `whole_name` (coming from an user) to `full_username`.
