### Changelog

#### New

* Now, every errors are covered by the custom dispy error display.

#### Changes

* Made some comment more comprehensible.
* When getting the result of an API request, you are no longer required to use `.get()`, you can directly get the value. (It was removed so don't use it)
* `bot.create_message()` was changed to `bot.send_message()`.

#### Fix

* Embeds can now have multiple images if an URL is specified.

### How to update my code?

Is there anyone using the lib anyway ðŸ˜‚?

1. Replace every `bot.create_message()` to `bot.send_message()`.&#x20;
2. When getting the result of an API request, you need to remove your `.get()` and directly get the values.
