This category is made to explain how to add functionalities to Dispy so you don't code blind.

### How to make a Pull Request?

Before doing some modifications, I really recommend you to make an issue on the github talking about the modifications you wanna make. (to not waste your time)

1. Fork the [repository](https://github.com/Dispy-inc/Dispy).
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b featureName`) with an unique name.
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m "description"`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin featureName`)
5. Open a pull request.

If this doesn't help you, this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A4TsoXJOs8) might.
