# Getting started

**Dispy** is a Python library that simplifies Discord bot development by handling all the complexities of asynchronous programming and API interactions. Unlike discord.py and discord.js, Dispy allows users to write straightforward Python code without worrying about intents, event loops, or async functions. The library runs everything asynchronously in the background, ensuring high performance without requiring the developer to manage any of it.

Whether you're building audio bots, text-based bots, or AI-powered bots, Dispy supports it all with minimal setup. Advanced users still have access to tools for more complex tasks, but for most, Dispyâ€™s streamlined approach makes Discord bot development as simple as coding in Tkinter.

* **Easy to Use**
* **Fast & Optimized**
* **Asyncronous Performance**
* **Powerful Rest API**
* **Resume Gateway Support**

Dispy lets bot developers focus on their ideas and the structure of their bots instead of getting lost in the complexities of learning a library. It simplifies the development process, making it easier to bring creative concepts to life without the usual hassle.
