# Supported Events

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is under construction!
{% endhint %}

***

Dispy is NOT finish so i will list the support of every event that discord can dispatch, not supported doesn't mean it cannot be used, but you will not have autocompletion and functions, so this is shit.

<table><thead><tr><th width="479">Event Name</th><th width="116">Supported</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MESSAGE_CREATE</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>DIRECT_MESSAGE_CREATE</td><td>✅</td></tr><tr><td>... Others</td><td>❌</td></tr></tbody></table>
